# heart-disease-classification

This project is working one of the most referenced dataset on heart disease, and try to build classification model with the dataset to predict heart disease.

In particular, machine learning models like random forest, SVM and logistic regression are applied with GridSearch. **And the best model is selected with Recall metric.**

Apart from sklearn models, H2O AutoML is also applied in search for the best performant model.

Look at the Colab in the repository for more details!
